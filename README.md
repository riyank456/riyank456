- 👋 Hi, I’m @riyank456
- 👀 I’m interested in positions that let me apply my strong technical background in data analysis, software development, and cybersecurity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning management information systems alongside finance (double major). I feel the blend of my two majors will prepare me well for technology positions in the ever-growing field of FinTech.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me apply what I have learned as well as pick up new skills and concepts. 
- 📫 You can reach me by email at riy.bk55@outlook.com
